so long as we can process it easily, and it makes some kind of sense.\n;; Main idea is to use a collection of clojure nested vectors - i.e. things in square brackets loosely mimicking an\n;; HTML document.\n;;\n;; The first element of the vector should be tagged with an identifier starting with a colon: e.g. :section, :p.\n;;\n;; Optionally, immediately after the tag, there may be an id, starting with a hash - such as #what-it-does.\n;; The code may use this id to index and locate the text. Ids should be unique.\n;;\n;; Optionally, there may also be a style or position indicator. These start with a '.'. e.g.  .input-box might be used to\n;; indicate that the text is closely attached to an input box, whereas '.input-widget' suggests it is relevant to one\n;; input in particular. But really, anything that makes sense is fine.\n;;\n;; It is also possible to pass parameters to the HTML element such as CSS styling. See the examples below.\n;;\n;; All text should be inside double quotes. Prefer single quotes inside text.
