so long as we can process it easily, and it makes some kind of sense.\n;; Main idea is to use a collection of clojure nested vectors - i.e. things in square brackets loosely mimicking an\n;; HTML document.\n;;\n;; The first element of the vector should be tagged with an identifier starting with a colon: e.g. :section, :p.\n;;\n;; Optionally, immediately after the tag, there may be an id, starting with a hash - such as #what-it-does.\n;; The code may use this id to index and locate the text. Ids should be unique.\n;;\n;; Optionally, there may also be a style or position indicator. These start with a '.'. e.g.  .input-box might be used to\n;; indicate that the text is closely attached to an input box, whereas '.input-widget' suggests it is relevant to one\n;; input in particular. But really, anything that makes sense is fine.\n;;\n;; It is also possible to pass parameters to the HTML element such as CSS styling.

However, Predict Prostate can never say with 100% certainty what will happen to an individual man. Note also that Predict Prostate is likely to be\n         less reliable in higher risk disease, as very few men with these characteristics were managed conservatively in our data.\n         The model is intended for newly diagnosed men where conservative management and radical treatment\n         are both appropriate options. The model also does not preclude the potential need for\n         deferred radical treatment in the future after initial conservative management, if the disease characteristics change. \")\n       (hr)\n       (faq-item \"If the data used is from patients decades ago won't the predictions it gives be out of date?\"\n         \"These predictions are based on patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, and include follow-up for up to 16 years.\n         In order to carry out long term predictions older data have to be used.

The data used for this model were from men diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 when MRI was rarely used,\n         and we did not have data on MRI-defined lesions, imaging scores (e.g. PIRADS) or MRI targeted biopsies. However, it is important to note that as yet using MRI data has not been shown to directly improve survival.\n         Its main benefit is in reducing the number of men investigated, better staging the cancer and to guide biopsies. Hence, we expect that the current use of MRI will provide a much more accurate assessment of where a man is in terms of disease extent and histological grade at diagnosis.\n         This in turn will better inform the prognostic predictions from Predict Prostate (e.g. moving a man from Grade Group 1 to\nGrade Group 2 or from Stage T2 to stage T3). If MRI data and imaging scores are shown in the\n         future to add independent value as a survival indicator then we will update\n         it into a future version of Predict Prostate.
