;; We'll attempt to keep text content here inside a useful structure - a sort of static database.
;;
;; The structure isn't too important so long as we can process it easily, and it makes some kind of sense.
;; Main idea is to use a collection of clojure nested vectors - i.e. things in square brackets loosely mimicking an
;; HTML document.
;;
;; The first element of the vector should be tagged with an identifier starting with a colon: e.g. :section, :p.
;;
;; Optionally, immediately after the tag, there may be an id, starting with a hash - such as #what-it-does.
;; The code may use this id to index and locate the text. Ids should be unique.
;;
;; Optionally, there may also be a style or position indicator. These start with a '.'. e.g.  .input-box might be used to
;; indicate that the text is closely attached to an input box, whereas '.input-widget' suggests it is relevant to one
;; input in particular. But really, anything that makes sense is fine.
;;
;; It is also possible to pass parameters to the HTML element such as CSS styling. See the examples below.
;;
;; All text should be inside double quotes. Prefer single quotes inside text. If you need a double quote inside text,
;; preface it with a backslash.

               but we have also tested the model on over 2,500 men diagnosed in Singapore. To the best of our knowledge the Predict tool should work equally well 
               for men currently diagnosed. However, Predict Prostate can never say with 100% certainty what will happen to an individual man. Note also that Predict Prostate is likely to be 
               less reliable in higher risk disease, as very few men with these characteristics were managed conservatively in our data. 
               The model is intended for newly diagnosed men where conservative management and radical treatment 
               are both appropriate options. The model also does not preclude the potential need for

               "Treatment does not work the same for everyone - whilst some people may get a large survival benefit, others may get very little or no benefit.
               All patients are at risk of the harmful side effects of treatment. Particularly in older men or men with other long-term conditions, 
               the overall survival benefits of prostate cancer treatment can be small.  This makes choosing whether
               or not to have radical treatment a difficult and personal choice.
               Predict Prostate tries to give the 'best guess' at the sort of benefits treatment might give a particular patient. This can help inform a personal decision on whether to go for immediate treatment or not.

     (faq-item "What about MRI?"
               "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used in prostate cancer diagnosis. The data used for this model were from men diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 when MRI was rarely used, 
               and we did not have data on MRI-defined lesions, imaging scores (e.g. PIRADS) or MRI targeted biopsies. However, it is important to note that as yet using MRI data has not been shown to directly improve survival. 
               Its main benefit is in reducing the number of men investigated, better staging the cancer and to guide biopsies. Hence, we expect that the current use of MRI will provide a much more accurate assessment of where a man is in terms of disease extent and histological grade at diagnosis. 
               This in turn will better inform the prognostic predictions from Predict Prostate (e.g. moving a man from Grade Group 1 to 
 Grade Group 2 or from Stage T2 to stage T3). If MRI data and imaging scores are shown in the 
               future to add independent value as a survival indicator then we will update 
               it into a future version of Predict Prostate. We are currently investigating this.")

               It also allows additional 'targeted biopsies' from lesions seen on MRI to be incorporated  into the model. A small number of hospitals may 
               however only take biopsies from parts of the prostate that look suspicious on MRI. In this circumstance, you should select âNoâ to 
               whether biopsy data is available as using only the figures from 'targeted' biopsies may lead to much less reliable estimates. 
               By reporting that biopsy data is unavailable, the average values will be used, which may make the estimates slightly less personalised. ")

     (faq-item "FAQ - What about if my biopsies show Intraductal and/or cribriform pattern"
               "These features are considered aggressive variants of prostate cancer and are most commonly associated with high grade group disease. The presence of these variants with lower grade disease (Grade Group1 or Grade Group 2) suggest they will behave more aggressively than expected. The presence of these variants with higher Grade disease is thought to confer a poorer outcome but as yet there is no different treatment offered in addition to standard radical therapy. Predict Prostate did not have data on these variants and hence the estimates for conservative versus radical therapy should be interpreted with extreme caution. Current opinion suggest that conservative management should not be a recommended option for men whose biopsies have these histological features."

     [:p "Welcome to Predict:Prostate, an online prognostication and treatment benefit tool designed to help clinicians and
     patients make informed decisions about treatment following diagnosis of non-metastatic prostate cancer.
     Predict:Prostate has been developed by a partnership between the Academic Urology Group and the Department of Cancer Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge
    in collaboration with the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) at Public Health England.
    This work has been supported by funding from The Urology Foundation and The Evelyn Trust.
    
    The model is easy to use following data entry for an individual patient including age, PSA, clinical stage, histological grade or gradegroup, proportion of positive biopsy cores and comorbidity information. 
    Treatment benefits for radical treatment are calculated using observed data within the East of England cohort. Radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy effects are combined as no randomised data has demonstrated a difference in survival. 
    Displays within the 'charts' and 'curves' are designed to display the uncertainty around this treatment benefit, effectively presenting a range in treatment effect from 0-100% reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality around our calculated survival estimate."]

     features you would like to have added to the model please let us know by emailing us at info@prostate.predict.nhs.uk."]]

      Prostate cancer-specific and non-prostate cancer mortality models were constructed using Cox proportional hazards and fractional polynomials, adjusting for known prognostic factors. 
      Further information about the model is available in abstracts presented at the European Association of Urology and American Urological Association conferences 2018.  "]]

     [:p "The clinical validity of a prediction model can be defined as the accuracy of the model to predict future
     events. The two key measures of clinical validity are calibration and discrimination."]

     [:p "Calibration is how well the model predicts the total number of events in a given data set. A perfectly
     calibrated model is one where the observed (or actual) number of events in a given patient cohort is the same as
     the number of events predicted by the model.\n\nDiscrimination is how well the model predicts the occurrence of an
     event in individual patients. The discrimination statistic is a number between zero and one. It is generally
     obtained from the area under a receiver-operator characteristic curve. If a random pair of patients is selected
     from a dataset - one being a survivor and the other a non-survivor - the discrimination is the probability that the
     non-survivor will have a higher predicted risk than the survivor."]]]
