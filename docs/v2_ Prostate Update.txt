-Addition of a 'print' button to enable export of outputs.
-A new graded colouring around estimated survival with radical treatment, as per David's suggestion. (If possible could this be added as another option alongside the 2 current presentations, and we can test which is most popular/effective).
-Moving 'treatment side effects' to the right - so that it's more obviously separate from the individualised results.
